15.08.2013
Fixed HTTP server not accepting connections on 64bit OS with QT5.

1.3.0
20.04.2013
Updated for compatibility QT 5. You may still use QT 4.7 or 4.8, if you like.
Also added support for logging source file name, line number and function name.

1.2.13
03.03.2013
Fixed Logger writing wrong timestamp for buffered messages.
Improved shutdown procedure. The webserver now processes all final signals before the destructor
finishes.

1.2.12
01.03.2013
Fixed HttpResponse sending first part of data repeatedly when the amount of data is larger than the
available memory for I/O buffer.

1.2.11
06.01.2013
Added clearing the write buffer when accepting a new connection, so that it does not send
remaining data from an aborted previous connection (which is possibly a bug in QT).

1.2.10
18.12.2012
Reduced memory usage of HttpResponse in case of large response.

1.2.9
29.07.2012
Added a mutex to HttpConnectionHandlerPool to fix a concurrency issue when a pooled object gets
taken from the cache while it times out.
Modified HttpConnectionHandler so that it does not throw an exception anymore when a connection
gets closed by the peer in the middle of a read.

1.2.8
22.07.2012
Fixed a possible concurrency issue when the file cache is so small that it stores less
files than the number of threads.

1.2.7
18.07.2012
Fixed HttpRequest ignores additional URL parameters of POST requests.
Fixed HttpRequest ignores POST parameters of body if there is no Content-Type header.
Removed unused tempdir variable from HttpRequest.
Added mutex to cache of StaticFileController to prevent concurrency problems.
Removed HTTP response with status 408 after read timeout. Connection gets simply closed now.
